This was originally a mod that was made for my personal use.

I created this mod so I could see how the underlying systems in video games work and interact with other systems
and see how I could enhance them and introduce new systems while keeping the game balanced and enjoyable. The reason
I picked Minecraft is because I was already familiar with Java at the time combined with the reasons above, essentially just
learning about games without having to learn a new language.

How to run the mod
Compile the project into a jar file using Gradle, add the mod to /mods folder in Minecraft.
Requires Curios (5.14.1 and above) mod to be present in the mods folder
